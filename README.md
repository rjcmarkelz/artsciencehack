# README for ArtScienceHack2

# Goals
* learn processing
* make interactive display using kinect
* model plant growth

## ideas
* human shapes translate to plant shapes
* growth sims over time using human shape to change parameters

## technical concerns
* kinect to gamify plants
* variable connections
* leaf/stem/root/flowering
* seed dispersal

## aesthetic
* L-Tree
* 2D-raytracer
* rendering shapes?

## Outcomes
For the most part this hackathon was a success to learn the basics of processing and then make some plant human interaction art with it.

Write-up coming soon when we have some more time to sift through the plots, demos and sketches.
